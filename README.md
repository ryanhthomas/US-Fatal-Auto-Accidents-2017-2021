# US-Fatal-Auto-Accidents-2017-2021

What are the major factors that affect the percentage of people involved in a fatal car accident who don't survive?  This analysis utilizes National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data from 2017-2021 on all fatal US car crashes and all people involved in them to try and find an answer.

Three main datasets were used in this analysis:
- NHTSA "Accidents" datasets from 2017-2021 - contains information about crash characteristics and environmental conditions at the time of the crash. There is one record per crash.
- NHTSA "Persons" datasets from 2017-2021 -  contains information describing all people involved in the crash including motorists (i.e., drivers and passengers of motor vehicles
in-transport) and non-motorists (e.g., pedestrians, pedalcyclists, and occupants of motor vehicles not in-transport). It provides information such as age, sex, vehicle occupantrestraint use, and injury severity. There is one record per person.
- US Census Bureau data for state populations
